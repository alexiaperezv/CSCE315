## Description
Have you ever wanted to go hiking but didn't know where to look for a good place to hike at?
Have you ever known a good place to hike but had too many other things to think about like food, water, weather, and what else to do?
Well then Hikipedia is the solution for you!
Our web application will help you plan the perfect trek by combining park, weather, and map APIs to give you detailed descriptions and data about parks & trails, the weather you might encounter, what clothes and materials to bring, how many calories you will burn, how much water you should drink, and much more!
