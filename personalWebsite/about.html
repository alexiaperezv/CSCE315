            <p class="mb-0">My name is Alexia Perez. I am a third-year student at Texas A&M University pursuing a 
              major in Computer Engineering with minors in Cybersecurity and Mathematics. I grew up in a small beachside town in Spain, where my parents still reside. At the age of 15, I received a scholarship to attend high school in the United States. During that year, I fully immersed myself in the American culture through my involvement as the manager of my high school’s championship-winning softball team. The following year, I moved in with the family of one of my teammates, and her parents became my legal guardians. Throughout my senior year, I worked as a part-time office assistant, which enabled me to fulfill my aspirations of attending college at Texas A&M University.

            <p class="mb-0">I decided to pursue an education in Computer Engineering because I enjoy the challenging problem-solving nature of the work. I subsequently added my minor in Mathematics because I valued a strong analytical foundation, and I added my Cybersecurity minor to gain a perspective on how my Computer Engineering coursework is commonly applied throughout industry. After graduation, I intend to pursue a career in cybersecurity at a company in big tech. I am excited about the fast-paced innovation in this field, and I am passionate about developing solutions that make people’s everyday lives easier.<br><br> 
              In my free time, I enjoy cooking, photography, and traveling around the world. Throughout my life, I have been to over a dozen countries, and I loved learning more about their languages, cuisines, and ways of life. You can see some pictures that I have taken of my adventures on this page. I am also very passionate about horseback riding and competitive showjumping, which I have been practicing since I was six years old.
